## The technical part of my published papers

This repository hosts the technical details of my first author publications. The titles are listed in the following:

- A Comparison of Recurrent and Convolutional Deep Learning Architectures for EEG Seizure Forecasting ([link](https://www.scitepress.org/PublicationsDetail.aspx?ID=RxgTgRng4GI=&t=1)).

- Calibrating Deep Learning Classifiers for Patient-Independent Electroencephalogram Seizure Forecasting ([link](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/9/2863)).

- Methodological Issues in Evaluating Machine Learning Models for EEG Seizure Prediction: Good Cross-Validation Accuracy Does Not Guarantee Generalization to New Patients ([link](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/7/4262)).
